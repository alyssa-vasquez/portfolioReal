        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>There are few applications<br />that connect personal trainers with their<br />clients. So, I created a mobile and<br />web based application that allows<br />trainers and their clients to easily<br />share information with each other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="three-col">
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>Trainers need an app that allows<br />them to organize multiple clients<br />and to train clients all over<br />the world. Clients need a way to view all<br />this information and share<br />information in return.</p>

      <div class="three-col">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>Create BPM Fitness to ensure that<br />connecting and sharing<br />information between personal<br />trainers and their clients is easy and<br />efficient.</p>

      <h1>Discovery Phase</h1>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>The main apps on the market that connect personal trainers with clients are Gain Fitness<br />and My PT Hub. Both apps promise trainers they can build their business and clientele.<br />However, these apps are marketed to the trainers not their clients and do not allow for<br />two-way communication.</p>
      <img src="/assets/competition.png">

      <h2>User Survey</h2>
      <p>I began with a survey to learn the following information:<br />What users use cloud storage for.<br />What features they use and what features they want.<br />How important is sharing files, real time collaboration, easy organization and file recovery.</p>
      <div class="greenbackground">
        <p>73% of participants were interested in personal training and fitness and of those participants:<br />91% were interested in viewing workouts, recipes and nutritional information<br />82% were interested in uploading progress pictures and leaving comments <br />73% wanted access to pictures and videos of exercises.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Of the participants that were interested a personal training app, 55% are men, 72% are<br />between the ages 18 and 34 and 55% have a bachelor's degree. All of this information<br />helped me to understand the users when developing this application.</p>

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>User Personas are build using the demographics found from the user survey so that a<br />clear version of the user is kept in mind throughout the entire design process.<br /><br />Target market research shows that personal trainers are college educated or have a<br />training certification and are looking to grow their client base and increase their<br />income. Clients are mostly male looking for weight training and women looking for<br />wieght loss methods like high intensity training and muscle toning. Nealry 40% of<br />clients are millenials, indicating that they are comfortable with technology.</p>

        <p>Mark<br />35, Male<br />Fitness Trainer<br />Los Angeles, CA<br /><br />Mark is interesed in the idea of a<br />cloud based sharing application<br />designed to connect personal<br />trainers and their clients<br />especially, for his clients that live<br />in other cities.<br /><br />This app would also help him<br />keep track of his LA clients’<br />various routines, goals, progress<br />and diets, something he admits he<br />could use help with. </p>

        <p>Giselle<br />28, Female<br />Photographer<br />San Diego, CA<br /><br />She is dedicated to working out<br />about three times a week but her<br />schedule makes it hard to work<br />with personal trainers. Giselle<br />likes to be able to workout from<br />her home with limited<br />equipment.<br /><br />She wants a plan tailored to her<br />specific goals, diet plans/recipes<br />and to be able to communicate<br />with a trainer. The last workout<br />plan was bought online, did not<br />fit her exact needs and did not<br />allow for collaboration.</p>

        <img src="/assets/Brandon.png">
        <p>Brandon<br />23, Male<br />Student<br />Boulder, CO<br /><br />Brandon spends a lot of time<br />working out and lifting weights in<br />the school gym and would like an<br />app that allows him to work with a<br />personal trainer. He would like to<br />be able to view training materials<br />and guides for his specific goals.<br /><br />Brandon would also like access<br />to recipes, since he doesn’t know<br />much about cooking, and wants<br />to gain muscle as quickly as<br />possible without relying on so<br />many supplements. </p>

    <section class="InfoArch">
      <h1>Information Architecture </h1>
      <h2>User Stories &amp; Flows</h2>
      <p>Clear user personas helped when it was time to determine the to the user stories to<br />think through a well-rounded app with the essential features for both the client and<br />the trainer. High priority stories included the onboarding process, logging in, adding<br />content, organizing content, deleting content, and signing out.<br /><br />The same user stories became user flows, essentially a path of each task. Building the<br />users flows was necessary in understanding how each page of the app worked, before<br />diving right into the visual design. </p>
      <img src="/assets/BPMFlows.png">

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>Then came wireframes and sketches of what each page would look like and an idea of<br />navigating from one page to the next. The wireframes were tested by three users and<br />received positive feedback as far as functionality goes. Users were asked to sign up for<br />an account, add a new progress picture, add a new check in, and find the workout for<br />day one and add a new meal plan.<br /><br />The feedback from the users testing was essential in determining if the app was<br /> intuitive. The feedback indicated that the both versions of the app were easy to use<br />and straight forward.</p>

    <section class="VisualDesign">
      <h1>Visual Design </h1>
      <h2>Logo Design</h2>
      <p>The goal was to create a brand that is inclusive for all types of training. Not everyone<br />lifts weights or does cardio so I stayed away from the classic dumbell and running<br />logos. BPM (beats per minute) represents all fitness types and the health benefits<br />from them.</p>
      <img src="/assets/BPMLogoDesigns.png">

      <h2>Branding &amp; Identity</h2>
      <p>The brand characteristics are strength, energy, fitness, health, versatility<br />and flexibility.<br /><br />I chose the magenta color for the main color for the mobile app for the clients<br />because it is bright and energetic without being overwhelming. The teal color is the<br />main color for the desktop/web version of the app for trainers because blue is the<br />color of trustworthiness and responsibility but the green hue makes it more vibrant<br />and energetic.</p>
      <img src="/assets/BPMColors.png">

      <h2>Prototype &amp; Testing</h2>
      <p>Various screen were voted on by users to determine their preference. Users voted<br />on the sign up and login screens for the mobile version and chose the simplest entry<br />forms. They voted on the background image for the desktop version sign up page<br />and well as the main layout for the landing page.</p>
      <img src="/assets/BPMPref1.png">
      <img src="/assets/BPMPref2.png">
      <p>Then users were tested on the clickable prototype to ensure that the app is easy to<br />use and users understand how to navigate it. It was important to include a script<br />with basic information about the app and what tasks they needed to complete. Tasks<br />for the mobile version included signing up, adding a progress picture, adding a check in, adding a<br />new meal plan, finding the workout for day one and signing out.<br /><br />The feedback supported the functionality of the desktop and mobile versions of the<br />app. Users had a really easy time navigating through the clickable prototypes and<br />nothing need to be changed based on their feedback.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>I had a great experience building this app and coming up with an idea that will do<br />really well in the fitness market. Completing research and analyzing the<br />competition was extremely important in verifying if there was even space for an app<br />like this. Looking at the features of the competition helped me determine what<br />features BPM Fitness needed to stay competitive as well as additional features to set<br />us apart.<br /><br />At first, I took on a really big project with way more features that I later realized<br />were beyond the scope of this project. Had I had more time, I would have loved to<br />add in those features such as the ability to add comments and recovering deleted<br />files. I’m glad I was able to determine the scale of this project early on and believe it<br />came out with all the necessary features.</p>
